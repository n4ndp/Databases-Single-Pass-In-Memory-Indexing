I was a young man just trying to make it rich Cocaine was a rich mans high and I was broke So i found a couple rich guys that snorted coke I remember rollin up brown weed in a Philly Smoking it and hearing scenes probably That shit was silly And now it's hard to believe that I was that guy at all And now i keep on slippin and I'm trying not to fall I'm fucking different woman trying to not get involved Cause the saying goes the higher we fly the harder we fall And through it all God never let me go I Said a prayer every day and I kept my soul Back when I was 15 years old I was Trying to figure out where I'm gunna go I was out tryina find a block of gold A rainbow I was chasing a rainbow Used to ride out everyday all alone trying to figure out why the Worlds so cold, now I think about my mama told me She said you can have it all but sent lose your soul Don't lose your soul Don't lose your soul I'm feeling like the phoenix how I'm raisin from the Ashes, now every mixed tape is a white trash Classic To tell you all the truth it's been a long road We came along way but we still got so far to go Do this for my brother in the federal pen And I promise you your not going back ever again Back then we were kids trying not to make the news Now we got this music thing and I think its breaking through but hold Up back then we had it so rough used to Do a couple shows but no body showed up And now everybody knows us there like here comes trouble Damn, I can't wait til i see my brother struggle Come on Back when i was 15 years old i was trying to figure out Where I'm gunna go, I was out trying find a block of gold A rainbow I was chasin a rain bow Used to ride out everyday all alone Trying to figure out why the worlds so cold now I think about the Words my mama told she said you can have it All, but don't lose your soul, don't lose your soul Don't lose your soul",Sobriety Sucks,Southern soul & hip hop,rap

Il dubbio dentro me E ho smesso di sperare Ma a un tratto, tu Risvegli nel profondo Un fuoco che mi accende I'll return to love and risk it all Per regalarti un mondo And I'll return to love and resterò Per costruire un sogno One more time Who cares about the past? Who knows about tomorrow? L'amore è adesso And maybe this won't last Maybe this moment's all we have Let's find out And though I'm still afraid You're worth a leap of faith I'll return to love and risk it all To see the world that we make I'll return to love and take the fall As if my heart cannot break One more time Here and now, up against the edge Promise me you won't look down Won't fall off the ledge Take my hand and show me how to love again And I'll return to love and risk it all Per regalarti un mondo And I'll return to love and take the fall Per costruire ancora One more time",Return To Love,Musica Italiana 2020 - Playlist Pop & Hip-Hop (Canzoni Italiane 2020),r&b

I know it get's tough out there You know what I'm sayin Struggles for real... Maybe this'll help you out man I know you gotta make your run But man, Spend some time with your daughter or your son Take a day or two to some 'em some fun Play your part as a dad Be responsible for what they become Because maybe that long talk, firm hug or that laugh Will help your kid read fluently or better at math It's gonna take more than just a school staff To prepare them for the struggle that awaits in their path It takes love You want the cars and the raw chains But you don't thank the Lord above for the small things The food in your fridge, your girl or your wife The source of it all, the one that brings the drive in your life Don't get me twisted, be about your bread But let the truth be said You'll go so further if you pray before you go to bed I put my heart in this song Because I've seen hate stirring us wrong But we can fix it with love Chorus (x2): The Globetroddas take your soul a ride Put all the pain and the strain and the stress aside Release yourself, don't be ashamed to do what you feel inside Throw up your hands, show some love. Love! I got love; for the first rapper paving the way To the highest paid rapper today Showed a young, inner city kid another way of livin' Who could have been another nigga dead or in prison Although the block brought me stress The block made me fresh The block propped me and wished me the best So when the homies got it rough out there We just reminisce the old days; chilling while we put it in the air Out of love We throw the family get-togethers backyard in the summer Party with no drama And dance with our Mamas to Pac's ""Dear Mama"" We grub good under the sun and pay homage To the elders, and gather 'round taking pictures And listen to that uncle who lies and bullshits ya And watch the little ones grow tight, run around 'til the sun goes down The whole vibe of this sound is straight love Chorus (x2) Globetrodda front-liner Derrick Buck Here with Drew, Big Drak and Chuck To turn it out no question, but mainly here to pass down a message: Your lifetime's the ultimate blessing Focus on the big picture and it puts it in perspective I know it gets hectic at times and nerve-wrecking But the sunshine's coming; good times are rolling along The struggle's only making us strong It's all love Chorus (x4)",The Love EP,Saxophone in Hip Hop - R&B Lounge - Jazz Rap,r&b

Just make this go away Just one more peaceful day And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste And everything I can't remember As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me I cannot blame this on my father He did the best he could for me And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry",The Singles,L' ALBUM ROCK,rock
